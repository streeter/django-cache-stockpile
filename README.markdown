===============
Stockpile Cache
===============

Stockpile provides limited automatic caching and invalidation for Django models
through the ORM. Objects fetched through `.objects.get(pk=..)` or
`.objects.get(id=..)` are cached by the primary key. In addition, there is
a way to get objects with the methods `.objects.pk_in(id_list)` and
`.objects.id_in(id_list)`.
